== Description ==

= Plugin Functions =

This WooСommerce and Simla.com integration plugin will help you manage your orders, catalogs and stock more easily by generating a catalog compatible with Simla.com system, setting up a two-way exchange of orders between WooCommerce and Simla.com; sending and receiving changes on orders, uploading leftovers from Simla.com to your online store automatically. How? By enabling the “stock unloading” function, your stock will be updated automatically every 15 minutes. This also means that you don’t have to manually hide sold out stock on your website: the system will do it for you automatically!

= Downloaded changes from  Simla.com =

Every 5 minutes the plugin downloads changes from Simla.com to WooCommerce.

= Customization =

You can make changes to the basic plugin classes by placing a copy of the class from the “include” directory to the “wp-content/retailcrm-custom” directory.

== Installation ==

= Activation and configuration =

After activating the plugin, open WooCommerce’s settings, select the “Integration” tab and specify the Simla.com address in Simla.com settings (for example: https://example.simla.com). You will also have to specify the API key generated by our system (instructions for adding a key to [Simla.com via](http://www.retailcrm.es/docs/Users/ApiKeys)) and select the desired API version (API v5 is available only from Simla.com 6.0 and on).
